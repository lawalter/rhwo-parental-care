# rhwo_parental_care

This repository is a collection of Red-headed Woodpecker parental care behavior data used for my Master's Thesis at Virginia Commonwealth University and for a manuscript in progress for publication. Behaviors investigated include incubation durations, brooding durations, provisioning frequencies, and nest cleaning frequencies for individually marked woodpeckers.

Data are sourced from video analyses completed using BORIS Software. Videos were recorded from April-Aug in 2017 and 2018 at Fort A. P. Hill, Virginia, USA. R scripts included are for wrangling, tidying, analyzing, and plotting these data.
